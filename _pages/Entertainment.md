13:22, 2019-09-08: Read the book *an introduction to game theory*. Amazed to know Von Neumann got his math Ph.D. only one year after he graduated in Chemistry. Also, he mastered Calculus when he was eight while some university students now are still struggling. I feel ashamed that he published his first work which eluded Borel in his second year. Really sorry for his only 54-year-long life. Maybe he wanted to leave something for us to do! :grin:

15:54, 2019-09-09: First day in the new term! Plus, happy birthday(lunar) to myself! Cannot wait to meet my real birthday!:laughing:

23:28, 2019-09-09: What a wonderful day! Everything is good and everyone is kind. Sleep tight guys!:smirk:

12:50, 2019-09-10: It seems that I cannot get the course I want... So sad...:cry:

18:16, 2019-09-10: Totally heartbroken to finally figure out that I have 2 over-600-page textbook, 1 over-400-page textbook, and 1 over-1400-page textbook(*art of assembly language*) to read this term already! Anyway, happy Teachers' day!

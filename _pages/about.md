*Hello, my name is Yuhao Mao. I am a math-and-finance-major undergraduate at CKC Honors College, Zhejiang University. Luckily, I was not restricted to my major and explored my interest in Computer Science. Currently I am instructed by Professor S.J. at NESA lab(see <https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/sji>), Professor K.L. at Department of Mathematics(see <https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0093199>) and Associate Professor G.Z. at Department of Economics(see <https://flzhou.weebly.com/>).*

My favorite formula includes: 

$$e^{\pi i}=-1$$

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{2\pi i x\xi}dx$$

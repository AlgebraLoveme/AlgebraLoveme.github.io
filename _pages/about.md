*Hello, my name is Yuhao Mao. I am an math-and-finance-majored undergraduate from CKC Honors College, Zhejiang University, China. Luckily, I was not restricted to my major and explored my interest in Computer Science. Currently I am guided by Professor S.J. at NESA lab(see <https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/sji>) and Associate Professor G.Z. at Department of Economics(see <https://flzhou.weebly.com/>).*

My favorite formula: $e^{\pi i}=-1$

*Hello, my name is Yuhao Mao. Starting September 2023, I join SRI lab at ETH Zürich as a PhD student. I got my master's degree in Computer Science at ETH Zürich and my Bachelor's degree in math and finance at CKC Honors College, Zhejiang University. I worked (or am still working) with [Dr. G. Zhou](https://flzhou.weebly.com), [Dr. S. Ji](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/people.html) (Bachelor thesis advisor), [Dr. X. Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhangxuhong), [Dr. Y. Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/students) and [Dr. M. Vechev](https://www.sri.inf.ethz.ch/people/martin) (PhD advisor), list sorted by time.*

My favorite formula includes: 

$$e^{\pi i}=-1$$

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{2\pi i x\xi}dx$$

Find my CV [here](../CV_en.pdf).

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or interests.

**Working Ethics**

I solemnly swear that I put 120% effort into making the proofs in all my publications, including those I am not the (co-)first author, *correct*, *rigorous* and *readable*.

## Publication

All publications are peer-reviewed in top-tier conferences/journals. Equal contributions are marked by *.

*Hello, my name is Yuhao Mao. I am a computer science MSc majoring in machine intelligence at ETH Zurich. Previously, I was a math-and-finance double-major undergraduate at CKC Honors College, Zhejiang University. I had been instructed by [Dr. G. Zhou](https://flzhou.weebly.com), [Dr. S. Ji](https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/people.html), [Dr. X. Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhangxuhong), and [Dr. Y. Zhang](https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/students) (listed by instruction date).*

My favorite formula includes: 

$$e^{\pi i}=-1$$

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{2\pi i x\xi}dx$$

Find my CV [here](https://algebraloveme.github.io/CV.pdf).

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or interests.

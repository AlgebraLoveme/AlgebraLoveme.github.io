*Hello, my name is Yuhao Mao. I am a computer science MSc majoring in machine intelligence at ETH Zurich. Previously, I was a math-and-finance double-major undergraduate at CKC Honors College, Zhejiang University. I had been instructed by Prof. K. Liu at School of Mathematical Sciences, ZJU (see <https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0093199>), Associate Prof. G. Zhou at School of Economics, ZJU  (see <https://flzhou.weebly.com>), Prof. S. Ji at NESA lab, ZJU (see <https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/people.html>) and Dr. Y. Zhang at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security (see <https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/students>).*

My favorite formula includes: 

$$e^{\pi i}=-1$$

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{2\pi i x\xi}dx$$

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or interests.

*Hello, my name is Yuhao Mao. I am a math-and-finance double-major undergraduate at CKC Honors College, Zhejiang University. I am not restricted to my major and currently exploring my interest in applicable artificial intelligence (robust machine learning). Currently I am instructed by Professor S.J. at NESA lab(see <https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/sji>), Professor K.L. at Department of Mathematics(see <https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0093199>) and Associate Professor G.Z. at Department of Economics(see <https://flzhou.weebly.com/>).*

My favorite formula includes: 

$$e^{\pi i}=-1$$

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{2\pi i x\xi}dx$$

Find my CV [here](algebraloveme.github.io/cv_Yuhao_Mao.pdf).

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or interests.

*Hello, my name is Yuhao Mao. I am a math-and-finance double-major undergraduate at CKC Honors College, Zhejiang University. I am not restricted to my major and currently exploring my interest in applicable artificial intelligence (robust machine learning). I had been instructed by Prof. K. Liu at Department of Mathematics (see <https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0093199>) and Associate Prof. G. Zhou at Department of Economics (see <https://flzhou.weebly.com/>). Currently I am instructed by Prof. S. Ji at NESA lab (see <https://nesa.zju.edu.cn/webpage/people.html>) and Dr. Y. Zhang at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security (see <https://yangzhangalmo.github.io/students>)*

My favorite formula includes: 

$$e^{\pi i}=-1$$

$$\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{2\pi i x\xi}dx$$

Find my CV [here](algebraloveme.github.io/CV.pdf).

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or interests.

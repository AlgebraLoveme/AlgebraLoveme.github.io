I am delighted to announce the initial release of [Chinese-dedede-Corrector (的地得修复器)](https://github.com/AlgebraLoveme/Chinese-dedede-corrector). This tool aims at correcting the more and more common mistakes in using 的地得, even in novels, movie subtitles and TV series. These words are as common as ``be`` in English, thus enforcing their correct usage is super important and beneficial.

This tool is still in a beta version, thus any comments and issues are encouraged. Thanks for the support and the commitment to a better Chinese language world!

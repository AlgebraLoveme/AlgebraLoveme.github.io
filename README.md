# Welcome to Yuhao Mao's personal page
*Hello, my name is Yuhao Mao. I am an math-and-finance-major undergraduate from CKC Honors College, Zhejiang University, China. Luckily, I was not restricted to my major and explored my interest in Computer Science. Currently I am guided by S.J. from NESA lab(see <https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/sji>) and G.Z. from Department of Economics(see <https://flzhou.weebly.com/>).*
